## Introduction Numpy

##### What is Numpy?

NumPy, short for Numerical Python, is the fundamental package required for high performance scientific computing and data analysis. It is the foundation on which nearly all of the higher-level tools in this book are built. Here are some of the things it provides:

- `ndarray`, a fast and space-efficient multidimensional array providing vectorized arithmetic operations and sophisticated *broadcasting* capabilities
- Standard mathematical functions for fast operations on entire arrays of data without having to write loops
- Tools for reading / writing array data to disk and working with memory-mapped files
- Linear algebra, random number generation, and Fourier transform capabilities
- Tools for integrating code written in C, C++, and Fortran



For most data analysis applications, the main areas of functionality Iâ€™ll focus on are:

- Fast vectorized array operations for data munging and cleaning, subsetting and filtering, transformation, and any other kinds of computations
- Common array algorithms like sorting, unique, and set operations
- Efficient descriptive statistics and aggregating/summarizing data
- Data alignment and relational data manipulations for merging and joining together heterogeneous data sets
- Expressing conditional logic as array expressions instead of loops with `if-elif-else` branches
- Group-wise data manipulations (aggregation, transformation, function application).
