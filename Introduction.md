### <a name="python-history"></a>Python History
From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))
>Python is a widely used high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than possible in languages such as C++ or Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale
 * Who led to create Python?<br>
  Guido van Rossum is the author of Python programming language, and continues to oversee the Python development process
 * Why named as Python?
 

### <a name="python-interpreter"></a>Python Interpreter

* It is generally used to execute snippets of Python language as a means to learning Python or for debugging purposes
* The prompt is usually `>>>`
* Some of the topics in coming chapters will be complemented with examples using the Python Interpreter
* A special variable `_` holds the result of last printed expression
* One can type part of command and repeatedly press Up arrow key to match commands from history
* Press `Ctrl+l` to clear the screen, keeping any typed command intact
* `exit()` to exit

>The library contains built-in modules (written in C) that provide access to system functionality such as file I/O that would otherwise be inaccessible to Python programmers, as well as modules written in Python that provide standardized solutions for many problems that occur in everyday programming.

>Some of these modules are explicitly designed to encourage and enhance the portability of Python programs by abstracting away platform-specifics into platform-neutral APIs
